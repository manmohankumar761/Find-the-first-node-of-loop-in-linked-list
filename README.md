# Find-the-first-node-of-loop-in-linked-list
Given a head of the singly linked list. If a loop is present in the list then return the first node of the loop else return NULL.

Custom Input format:
A head of a singly linked list and a pos (1-based index) which denotes the position of the node to which the last node points to. If pos = 0, it means the last node points to null, indicating there is no loop.

Examples:

Input:
 
Output: 3
Explanation: We can see that there exists a loop in the given linked list and the first node of the loop is 3.
Input:
 
Output: -1
Explanation: No loop exists in the above linked list.So the output is -1.

### code

class Solution {
public:
    static Node* findFirstNode(Node* head) {
        if (head == nullptr) {
            return nullptr;
        }

        Node* slow = head;
        Node* fast = head;

        while (fast != nullptr && fast->next != nullptr) {
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next->next;

            if (slow == fast) {
                slow = head;
                while (slow != fast) {
                    slow = slow->next;
                    fast = fast->next;
                }
                return slow;
            }
        }
        return nullptr;
    }
};
